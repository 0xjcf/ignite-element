Ignite Element is a lightweight layer for building framework-agnostic custom elements. It keeps rendering and state separate:

- **State adapters** map your favorite state library (XState, Redux Toolkit, MobX) into Ignite’s lifecycle.
- **Renderers** decide how templates are produced: Ignite JSX (default) or lit.
- **Config** lives in `ignite.config.ts`, where you set renderer defaults, logging, and shared styles.

The end result is a web component factory with typed `states`, `commands`, and `events`, so you can compose UI in any host framework—or none at all.

Use the left nav to dive into concepts, or jump to the [Installation](/getting-started/installation/) and [first component](/getting-started/first-component/) guides to start coding.
