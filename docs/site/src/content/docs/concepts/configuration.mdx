`ignite.config.ts` is the single place to define renderer defaults, styles, and diagnostics.

```ts
// ignite.config.ts
import { defineIgniteConfig } from 'ignite-element/config';

export default defineIgniteConfig({
  renderer: 'ignite-jsx', // or "lit"
  strategy: 'diff', // "diff" | "replace"
  styles: new URL('./styles.css', import.meta.url).href, // injected into each shadow root
  logging: 'warn', // "off" | "warn" | "debug"
});
```

### Loading the config

- With Vite or Webpack plugins, the config is auto-imported (install and register the plugin in your bundler config).
- Without plugins, import it in your app entry so the renderer and styles are applied before you register components.

Default behavior:
- If `renderer` is not set, Ignite defaults to `ignite-jsx`.
- If you set a renderer that isn’t registered, Ignite falls back to `ignite-jsx` and logs a warning.

### Scoped vs. global styles

The `styles` URL is injected into each component’s shadow root. Add additional light-DOM styles in your host app as usual.

### Per-component overrides

Renderer and strategy are intended to be configured globally. Per-component overrides for render strategy are internal and not part of the public API; keep behavior discoverable in `ignite.config.ts`.
