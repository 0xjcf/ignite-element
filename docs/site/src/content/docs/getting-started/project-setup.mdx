- **Node & package manager**: use Node 22+. Use your preferred package manager (pnpm, npm, or yarn) consistently.
- **TypeScript JSX**: set `"jsx": "react-jsx"` and `"jsxImportSource": "ignite-element/jsx"`; add the pragma per-file if you cannot change `tsconfig`.
- **Bundler plugin**: add `igniteConfigVitePlugin()` (Vite) or `IgniteConfigWebpackPlugin` (Webpack) so `ignite.config.ts` is loaded automatically.
- **Testing**: add a test runner (Vitest or Jest) and include a smoke test for each web component (mount + basic interaction). Run with your package manager (`npm test`, `pnpm test`, etc.).
- **Linting/formatting**: use your preferred stack (ESLint/Prettier, Biome, etc.) and run it via your package manager. The published package doesn’t impose a formatter.
