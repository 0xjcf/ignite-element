# examples/agent: add actor-web-backed real-agent dogfood using igniteTools

## Source
Created with `fas create-task` on 2026-07-05.

## Problem
Add a focused dogfood example that points a real agent loop at an actor-web-backed ignite component through igniteTools. The goal is to prove the closed loop across actor-web source projection, command execution, emitted events, canExecute/tool gating where applicable, and view-grounded observations without making ignite-element own actor-web runtime semantics. Prefer the established Actor-Web + Ignite DX: defineActor -> defineActorWebTopology -> igniteCore, explicit topology.source(actorKey), and commands that call actor.send or actor.ask. Live model validation may use the OpenAI-compatible/MLX path, but CI must remain deterministic with fake provider responses.

## Acceptance criteria
- A runnable example drives an actor-web-backed ignite component through igniteTools and a real-model-compatible agent loop.
- Tests prove the loop through deterministic provider fixtures, including command execution and view/event observations.
- The example preserves ignite-element boundaries: Ignite projects and commands, actor-web owns runtime/topology mechanics, and provider SDKs stay outside core.
- Any actor-web transport or remote-runtime limitations are documented honestly instead of hidden behind an example-local abstraction.
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.
- The task is queued in `.fas/queue/tasks.json` for the runtime.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- examples/agents
- docs/v3-stable-roadmap.md
- docs/ignite-tools.md

## Scope Amendments
- 2026-07-06: `packages/ignite-element/src/actor-web.ts` was demoted to
  reference-only after architecture/staff/root review confirmed the dogfood can
  use the existing `ignite-element/actor-web` bridge without changing the public
  package API. The implementation belongs in the self-contained smart-home
  example.

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
