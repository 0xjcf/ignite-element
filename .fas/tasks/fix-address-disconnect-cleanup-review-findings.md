# fix: address disconnect cleanup review findings

## Source
Created with `fas create-task` on 2026-07-05.

## Problem
Fourth CodeRabbit committed review returned two findings: make IgniteElement deferred disconnect cleanup exception-safe so adapter shutdown runs in finally, and correct .changeset/ignite-shell.md so @ignite-element/renderer receives a minor bump for the new public JSX export.

## Acceptance criteria
- IgniteElement disconnect teardown stops non-shared adapters even when onTrueDisconnect throws.
- A focused regression covers the exception-safe adapter cleanup path.
- ignite-shell changeset marks @ignite-element/renderer as minor while keeping ignite-element as minor.
- Focused verification passes before batch snapshot.
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- packages/ignite-element/src/IgniteElement.ts
- packages/ignite-element/src/tests/IgniteElementFactory.test.ts
- .changeset/ignite-shell.md

## Scope Amendments
- None.

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
