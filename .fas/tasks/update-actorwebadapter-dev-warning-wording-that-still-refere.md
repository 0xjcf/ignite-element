# update ActorWebAdapter dev-warning wording that still references the removed commandSource config concept after the beta

## Source
Created with `fas create-task` on 2026-06-23.

## Problem
After commandSource was removed (PR #67), these messages still say 'commandSource' which no longer exists in the public API: failInvariant 'Actor-Web commandSource is required.' at packages/ignite-adapters/src/adapters/ActorWebAdapter.ts ~289 and ~327 (resolveCommandActor), and the send() console.warn 'Cannot send events without an Actor-Web commandSource.' ~468. Reword to reference 'a command-capable source (one that exposes send())'. Internal dev warnings only; behavior unchanged. Nit deferred from PR #67 babysit to avoid churning a green PR.

## Acceptance criteria
- The change is verified and does not introduce regressions.
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.
- The task is queued in `.fas/queue/tasks.json` for the runtime.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- packages/ignite-adapters/src/adapters/ActorWebAdapter.ts
- packages/ignite-element/src/tests/adapters/ActorWebAdapter.test.ts

## Scope Amendments
- Type: test-scope
- Added at: 2026-07-03
- Trigger: warning wording needs runtime-facing regression coverage
- Reason: The adapter warning/error strings are exercised through the existing ignite-element ActorWebAdapter vitest suite.
- Added paths: packages/ignite-element/src/tests/adapters/ActorWebAdapter.test.ts
- Evidence source: focused-test
- Evidence: focused-test | packages/ignite-element/src/tests/adapters/ActorWebAdapter.test.ts
- Accuracy signal: focused test failed before implementation and passed after wording update
- Follow-up needed: none

- Type: test-scope
- Added at: 2026-07-03
- Trigger: explicit affected test path recorded
- Reason: Refresh generated planning and task packet after adding ActorWebAdapter.test.ts to task scope.
- Evidence source: task-brief
- Evidence: task-brief | .fas/tasks/update-actorwebadapter-dev-warning-wording-that-still-refere.md
- Accuracy signal: affected files now match live ChangeSet
- Follow-up needed: none

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
