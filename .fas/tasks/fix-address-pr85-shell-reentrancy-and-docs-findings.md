# fix: address PR85 shell reentrancy and docs findings

## Source
Created with `fas create-task` on 2026-07-06.

## Problem
CodeRabbit flagged shell lifecycle reentrancy, test cleanup, and docs metadata
issues during PR85 closeout. The shell should mark itself active before running
`onConnect` so reentrant connects do not call the hook twice, tests should
restore console spies, and the related example docs/FAS inventories should match
the files and subscription ordering under review.

## Acceptance criteria
- The defect no longer reproduces.
- A regression test covers the fix.
- The shell tests restore console spies after each run.
- The example docs/FAS inventories include the reviewed files and subscription ordering.
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- packages/ignite-element/src/igniteShell.ts
- packages/ignite-element/src/tests/igniteShell.test.ts
- .fas/tasks/examples-add-worked-apps-form-with-validation-nested-child-r.md
- examples/adapters/xstate/README.md

## Scope Amendments
- None.

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
