# igniteTools PR 3: OpenAI ToolDialect adapter (ignite-element/tools/openai) — implement the ToolDialect port for OpenAI C

## Problem
igniteTools PR 3: OpenAI ToolDialect adapter (ignite-element/tools/openai) — implement the ToolDialect port for OpenAI Chat Completions tool format (functions / tool_calls / role:tool); covers OpenAI, Codex, and Ollama via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint; pure SDK-free translator; golden fixtures (TDD); manual validation = headless OpenAI loop + a local Ollama (OpenAI-compat) loop, proving the port generalizes cloud->local. Depends on PR1 (igniteTools core + ToolDialect port). Hexagonal design: docs/ignite-tools.md

## Automation admission
- Expected operator value: Improves operator leverage around "igniteTools PR 3: OpenAI ToolDialect adapter (ignite-element/tools/openai) — implement the ToolDialect port for OpenAI Chat Completions tool format (functions / tool_calls / role:tool); covers OpenAI, Codex, and Ollama via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint; pure SDK-free translator; golden fixtures (TDD); manual validation = headless OpenAI loop + a local Ollama (OpenAI-compat) loop, proving the port generalizes cloud->local.

- Observability surface: Use authoritative FAS surfaces such as `fas runtime status`, `fas runtime watch`, workflow logs, receipts, or notifications to show whether the automation is active, quiet, stalled, blocked, or complete.
- Recovery path: A human can abort, retry, recover, or rerun this workflow without leaving stale queue, lease, branch, or current-task state.
- Autonomy mode: advisory
- Promotion criteria: Promote beyond advisory only after dogfood runs prove clear operator value, trustworthy observability, and bounded recovery.

## Acceptance criteria
- The defect no longer reproduces.
- A regression test covers the fix.
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- Scope unknown.

## Scope Amendments
- None.

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
