# Harden beta dist-tags for scoped lockstep packages

## Source
Created with `fas create-task` on 2026-07-18.

## Problem
Repair and verify the beta release flow so ignite-element and all three scoped packages publish the same prerelease under the beta dist-tag while the stable latest tag remains unchanged until v3 stable. Start from the live registry discrepancy: ignite-element beta points to 3.0.0-beta.8, while the scoped package beta tags remain at 3.0.0-beta.2 and latest points to beta.8. Add automated pre-publish or post-publish assertions where practical, document an explicit recoverable npm dist-tag repair command, and prove a dry run cannot publish.

## Acceptance criteria
- All four packages resolve through the beta dist-tag to the same planned prerelease version.
- The beta flow does not move ignite-element latest away from 2.2.2 before stable.
- Scoped-package latest and beta tag behavior is explicit, tested, and recoverable.
- The inert dry-run path remains incapable of publishing.
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.
- The task is queued in `.fas/queue/tasks.json` for the runtime.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- scripts/release-beta.mjs
- scripts/release-beta.test.mjs
- package.json
- docs/v3-stable-roadmap.md

## Scope Amendments
- None.

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
