# fix: address CodeRabbit closeout findings for v3 examples epic

## Source
Created with `fas create-task` on 2026-07-05.

## Problem
CodeRabbit committed review against beta returned four findings: runtime host override unwinding in IgniteElementFactory, dashboard alertDismissed emission on no-op dismissal, nested router navigation not synchronizing History API, and routerStore not seeding deep links from the browser URL. The closeout also needed the FAS `testCommand` lane to cover the new example runtime tests consistently.

## Acceptance criteria
- withRuntimeHost restores the correct active runtime host/additional args under overlapping async calls.
- dashboard DISMISS_ALERT only emits alertDismissed after a real dismissal.
- nested-child-router navigate updates browser history and popstate updates router state.
- routerStore starts from the current browser path when available.
- `.fas-config.json` points FAS verification at the full lane that includes package
  and example runtime tests.
- Focused regression tests pass before batch snapshot.
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- packages/ignite-element/src/IgniteElementFactory.ts
- packages/ignite-element/src/tests/testing.test.ts
- examples/apps/dashboard-with-shared-state/src/dashboardModel.ts
- examples/apps/dashboard-with-shared-state/src/dashboard.headless.test.ts
- examples/apps/nested-child-router/src/router.tsx
- examples/apps/nested-child-router/src/routerStore.ts

## Scope Amendments
- Type: scope-refresh-promotion
- Added at: 2026-07-05
- Trigger: dirty-low-confidence-scope
- Reason: Promoted dirty low-confidence or dependency-reachable task-packet path(s) into affected scope.
- Added paths: packages/ignite-element/src/IgniteElementFactory.ts
- Evidence source: task-packet dirty scope promotion
- Evidence: task-packet dirty scope promotion | .fas/state/task-packet.json | Promoted dirty path(s): packages/ignite-element/src/IgniteElementFactory.ts
- Accuracy signal: Path was dirty in git status and present in task-packet low-confidence/dependency-reachable scope.

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
