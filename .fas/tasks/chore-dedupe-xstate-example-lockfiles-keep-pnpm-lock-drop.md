# chore: dedupe xstate example lockfiles (keep pnpm-lock, drop

## Source
Created with `fas create-task` on 2026-06-12.

## Problem
Pre-stable-v3 audit finding F8. git tracks BOTH packages/ignite-element/src/examples/xstate/package-lock.json AND pnpm-lock.yaml for the same example. Two lockfiles drift independently and give example users ambiguous install instructions. Keep pnpm-lock.yaml (matches the workspace toolchain), delete package-lock.json, and confirm the example README install instructions reference pnpm (or a package-manager-neutral command). The example dir is excluded from the npm package (files: dist) so this is repo-hygiene only.

## Acceptance criteria
- package-lock.json removed from the example and gitignored if regenerable
- example README install instructions match the retained lockfile
- example still installs and runs (vite dev/build) with pnpm
- TDD: a failing test that captures the new or changed behavior is written before the implementation and lands in the same change.
- TDD: every production code change in the change set is covered by an added or updated test.
- DDD: respect domain boundaries — keep the functional core deterministic and side-effect-free (no reads, writes, network, or clock), confine coordination to the imperative shell, and have adapters return facts instead of throwing.
- The work is tracked in `.fas/TASKS.md`.
- The task has a clear implementation and verification plan before execution starts.
- The task is queued in `.fas/queue/tasks.json` for the runtime.

## Proposed solution
- Use the supplied problem context, acceptance criteria, and affected-file hints to draft the concrete implementation approach during planning.

## Alternatives considered
- None recorded at task creation. Add rejected approaches during planning if scope tradeoffs appear.

## Affected files
- Scope unknown.

## Scope Amendments
- None.

## Implementation plan
- Convert the supplied context into a scoped implementation plan before editing.
- Refresh affected-file scope before implementation if the generated hints are incomplete.

## Verification plan
- Run `fas validate-task` for the inner-loop verification gate.
- Run `.fas/scripts/verify.sh --full` at the final release-quality gate when tracked files change.

## Risks
- Validate generated scope, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence before closeout to avoid workflow drift.

## Dependencies
- None known at task creation.

## Open questions
- None captured at task creation.
