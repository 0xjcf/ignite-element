# ignite-adapters

## 3.0.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- Publish the supporting packages under the `@ignite-element` npm scope: `ignite-core` → `@ignite-element/core`, `ignite-adapters` → `@ignite-element/adapters`, `ignite-renderer` → `@ignite-element/renderer`. The main `ignite-element` package keeps its unscoped name. Import paths move accordingly (e.g. `@ignite-element/adapters/xstate`); `ignite-element` consumers are unaffected since the siblings are internal dependencies resolved at install time.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @ignite-element/core@3.0.0-beta.2

## 3.0.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- Mark the state-library and renderer peers as optional so consumers only install what they actually use. `xstate`, `redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, and `mobx` are pick-one adapters, and `lit-html` is only needed for the opt-in `lit` render strategy — the default renderer is `ignite-jsx`, which pulls no `lit-html` at runtime. Installing `ignite-element` with one adapter (e.g. `npm i ignite-element xstate`) no longer drags in the other state libraries or emits unmet-peer warnings for them.
