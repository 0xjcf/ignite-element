# ignite-renderer

## 3.0.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- Mark the state-library and renderer peers as optional so consumers only install what they actually use. `xstate`, `redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, and `mobx` are pick-one adapters, and `lit-html` is only needed for the opt-in `lit` render strategy — the default renderer is `ignite-jsx`, which pulls no `lit-html` at runtime. Installing `ignite-element` with one adapter (e.g. `npm i ignite-element xstate`) no longer drags in the other state libraries or emits unmet-peer warnings for them.
