Publish the supporting packages under the `@ignite-element` npm scope: `ignite-core` → `@ignite-element/core`, `ignite-adapters` → `@ignite-element/adapters`, `ignite-renderer` → `@ignite-element/renderer`. The main `ignite-element` package keeps its unscoped name. Import paths move accordingly (e.g. `@ignite-element/adapters/xstate`); `ignite-element` consumers are unaffected since the siblings are internal dependencies resolved at install time.
