Promote the view-first single-source DX so object snapshots spread their fields directly onto the view context. `ViewContext<Snapshot>` now resolves to `Snapshot & { snapshot: Snapshot }` for object snapshots, letting view callbacks destructure `context`, `transport`, `phase`, etc. at the top level while `snapshot` stays available for the full read model. Non-object snapshots keep the `{ snapshot }` shape.
